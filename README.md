# ratings_talk

This is a companion repo to my Pydata 2019 talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKHh4nFpklE

Please refer to bundesliga_data_ratings.ipynb for examples of how to implement the available python packages for elo/glicko/trueskill. This is not a teaching notebook. It's meant only as a reference.

The other notebook plots_for_presentation.ipynb is just that. It contains a bunch of latex expressions for me to copy over and some random plots. Feel free to ignore it.
